# 🖼️ Image Segmentation with U-Net

This project demonstrates **image segmentation** using a **U-Net architecture** implemented in TensorFlow/Keras. The goal of image segmentation is to classify each pixel of an image into different categories (e.g., object vs. background).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

* Built a **U-Net** model from scratch.
* Preprocessed input images using **OpenCV**.
* Generated segmentation masks using the trained U-Net.
* Visualized results by overlaying predicted masks on the original images.
* Demonstrated how U-Net can be applied for tasks like medical image segmentation, road detection, and object extraction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
* **Image Processing**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow (PIL)
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib

✅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the use of a U-Net architecture for image segmentation. With its encoder–decoder structure, U-Net proves to be highly effective in learning spatial features and generating pixel-wise predictions. While the current implementation shows the workflow with sample inputs, training on a well-prepared dataset can achieve accurate and meaningful segmentation results.

This project can serve as a solid foundation for real-world applications such as:

Medical imaging (tumor/organ segmentation)

Self-driving cars (road and lane detection)

Satellite imagery (land cover classification)

General object extraction in computer vision

By extending this project with proper datasets, data augmentation, and advanced variants of U-Net, the segmentation performance can be significantly improved.
